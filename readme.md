## Sephora and Ulta Beauty Location Scraper

This is a web-scraping project at work. (DKC Analytics)

Our client wants to understand geo-location of stores from these two huge beauty retail brands, and the information can help them decide the prime market of targetting their audience.

For Sephora, I use the bs4 library to get the information. For Ulta, I use selenium and bs4 because there are interactive buttons on the web for getting the information.
