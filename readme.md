## Sephora and Ulta Beauty Location Scrapper

This is a web-scrapping project at work. 
Our client wants to understand geo-location of stores from these two huge beauty retail brands, and the information can help them decide the prime market of targetting their audience.

For Sephora, I use the bs4 library to get the information.

For Ulta, I use selenium and bs4 because there are interactive buttons on the web for getting the information.
